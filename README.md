# SW-420-tsunami-detection
TsunamiDetection using sw-420 VibrationSensor and RaspberryPi along with the SIM7600EI 4G module for notifying it over a cellular network.

Although it is definitely not much about what the code is doing here.The repository deals with the problems one face while being new at IoT 
and get stuck with interfacing a onBoard computer with the peripherals , It is very necessary to understand the cellular networking although internet and available API's have solved the problem of communicating 
to a large extent ,It's often about the security and likewise there are many advantages of using a cellular 4G network.
The project in a nutshell detects any unusual movement around and notifies it to the other end, now what's the use of using a pi and make things complex???
onboard computers can connect multiple sensors and process it at the same time and then notify it through multiple options.This repo shows the working with one sensor 
which can be extended to any number of sensors and processing it accordingly may exactly notify and process when there is truly a tsunami or some unusual movement.
